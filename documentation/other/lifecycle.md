# Lifecycle

Nodes have their own lifecycles, directly using the related classes of `androidx.lifecycle`.

## Capping
No `Node` can be in a higher lifecycle state than any of its parents or the Android Activity it lives in.

## Off-screen
`Nodes` can be kept alive by their parents when removed from the view (they'll be `STOPPED`)

When `Nodes` are removed completely from their parents, they'll be `DESTROYED`

## Lifecycle changes
The lifecycle state can be affected by:

- The routing source of the parent (adding or removing child `Nodes`)
- The parent's lifecycle state capping its children (transitive in the tree)
- Android lifecycle (Activity) capping the whole tree

## Back stack node lifecycle

An example demonstrating the above:

Note that routing sources might have their slight differences (e.g. whether their operations remove a `Node` only from the view, or completely destroy it).

In the case of the back stack:

- The `Push` operation adds a new element and stashes the currently active one â€“ the stashed one will be removed from the view & `STOPPED`
- The `Pop` operation removes an element, the child `Node` will be `DESTROYED`
