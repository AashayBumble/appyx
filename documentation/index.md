# Appyx


Application mechanics for your Android apps, built on top of Jetpack Compose


## In a nuthshell

Appyx comes with simple but powerful abstractions:

1. Represent your application as a composition of encapsulated components with their own lifecycle
2. Add dynamism to the component tree by granular navigation bits
3. Add custom on-screen and off-screen states for your components with history and powerful transitions


## Routing sources

Routing sources are the powerful engines driving all component state changes:

![video1]() ![video2]() ![video3]() ![video4]()

All of the above are different implementations of the same abstraction.


## Sensible defaults, powerful extensibility

You can define as many custom states for your components as you wish. 

All state transitions can have history and be animated by all the power of Jetpack Compose. 

Appyx comes with both a set of common implementations (e.g. back stack, tab switching) and the ability to define your own.
