# Appyx Navigation


An Android navigation library for Jetpack Compose that uses **Appyx Interactions** for its transitions and gesture-based navigation.


## Multiplatform status & WIP notice

Appyx navigation is currently being converted to a multiplatform project. Most concepts will not change, however new platform-agnostic parts are not yet documented as of yet.

Some of the documentation might also contain outdated terminology from **1.x**.
